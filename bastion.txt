For example, run the following command to see the account number and your user ID:

aws sts get-caller-identity
If you have any EC2 instances running in the sandbox, running this command would provide information about them:

aws ec2 describe-instances

Using the AWS SDK for Python
The terminal also has Python 3 installed with the boto 3 library available. You can use it to run AWS Python SDK code. For example:

$ python3
>>> import boto3
>>> ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-east-1')  
>>> ec2.describe_regions()
>>> exit()
$
